![](BPI_Bank.jpeg)

## Introduction
This project was developed for BPI Bank as a freelance project, where I created an interactive financial dashboard to analyze key performance indicators such as revenue, profit margins, assets, liabilities, and market ratios. The dataset was provided by BPI, and my goal was to transform raw financial data into meaningful, easy-to-understand insights for decision-makers.

With this dashboard, stakeholders can track financial trends over a 10-year period, assess the bankâ€™s market performance, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

## Excel Concepts Applied
To build this dashboard, I used various Excel techniques and tools to ensure accuracy, automation, and interactivity:
- Power Query âš¡ â€“ For data cleaning, transformation, and structuring.
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts ðŸ“Š â€“ For dynamic data analysis and visualization.
- Conditional Formatting ðŸŽ¨ â€“ To highlight trends, variances, and key financial metrics.
- Data Validation & Dropdowns âœ… â€“ For interactive filters (e.g., year selection).
- Formulas & Functions ðŸ§®
- LOOKUP functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) â€“ To fetch relevant financial data.
- IF & Nested IFs â€“ For logical comparisons and conditional reporting.
- SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS â€“ For category-based financial aggregations.
- Financial Modeling (DCF Analysis) ðŸ“‰ â€“ For valuation and future growth forecasting.
These Excel techniques ensured efficiency, accuracy, and interactivity, making the dashboard user-friendly and insightful.

## About the Dataset
The dataset was provided by BPI Bank and contains 10 years of financial data (2014-2023), covering:
- Income Statement â€“ Revenue, EBITDA, net income, and profit margins.
- Balance Sheet â€“ Assets, liabilities, and equity trends.
- Cash Flow â€“ Operating, investing, and financing cash flows.
- Market Ratios â€“ ROA, ROE, EPS, and P/E ratio.
- Risk & Capital Metrics â€“ Capital adequacy ratio, risk-weighted assets, and tier-1 capital.
- This data was cleaned, structured, and visualized to highlight trends, comparisons, and financial performance insights.
